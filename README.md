> This package is a fork of [`cdpdriver/zendriver`](https://github.com/cdpdriver/zendriver/), which itself is a fork of [`ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver`](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver/), created to add new features, compile unmerged bugfixes, and increase community engagement.

Truedriver is a blazing fast, async-first, undetectable webscraping/web automation framework implemented using the Chrome Devtools Protocol. Visit websites, scrape content, and run JavaScript using a real browser (no Selenium/Webdriver) all with just a few lines of Python.

**Docker support is here!** Check out [`cdpdriver/truedriver-docker`](https://github.com/cdpdriver/truedriver-docker) for an example of how to run Truedriver with a real, GPU-accelerated browser (not headless) in a Docker container. (Linux-only)

## Features

- **Undetectable** - Truedriver uses the Chrome Devtools Protocol instead of Selenium/WebDriver, making it (almost) impossible to detect
- **Blazing fast** - Chrome Devtools Protocol is _fast_, much faster than previous Selenium/WebDriver solutions. CDP combined with an async Python API makes Truedriver highly performant.
- **Feature complete and easy to use** - Packed with allowing you to get up and running in just a few lines of code.
- **First-class Docker support** - Traditionally, browser automation has been incredibly difficult to package with Docker, especially if you want to run real, GPU-accelerated Chrome (not headless). Now, deploying with Docker is easier than ever using the officially supported [truedriver-docker project template](https://github.com/cdpdriver/truedriver-docker).
- **Automatic cookie and profile management** - By default, uses fresh profile on each run, cleaning up on exit. Or, save and load cookies to a file to avoid repeating tedious login steps.
- **Smart element lookup** - Find elements selector or text, including iframe content. This could also be used as wait condition for a element to appear, since it will retry for the duration of `timeout` until found. Single element lookup by text using `tab.find()` accepts a `best_match flag`, which will not naively return the first match, but will match candidates by closest matching text length.
- **Full iframe support** - Switch between iframe contexts to interact with embedded content like hCaptcha, forms, or any other iframe-based widgets. Supports finding frames by URL, name, element, or index.
- **Simple proxy support** - Easy proxy configuration with multiple formats including authenticated proxies. Works reliably with Chrome, Brave, and Edge using URL-based authentication (like Playwright).
- **Easy debugging** - Descriptive `repr` for elements, which represents the element as HTML, makes debugging much easier.

## Installation

To install, simply use `pip` (or your favorite package manager):

```sh
pip install truedriver
# or uv add truedriver, poetry add truedriver, etc.
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Example for visiting [https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection](https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection) and saving a screenshot of the results:

```python
import asyncio

import truedriver as td


async def main():
    browser = await td.start()
    page = await browser.get("https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection")
    await page.save_screenshot("browserscan.png")
    await browser.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Iframe Interaction

Interact with embedded content like hCaptcha, forms, or widgets:

```python
import asyncio
import truedriver as td

async def main():
    browser = await td.start()
    tab = await browser.get("https://example.com/page-with-iframe")

    # Find iframe by URL pattern
    hcaptcha_frame = await tab.find_frame_by_url(r".*hcaptcha\.com.*")
    if hcaptcha_frame:
        # Switch to the iframe
        await tab.switch_to_frame(hcaptcha_frame)

        # Now interact with elements inside the iframe
        checkbox = await tab.find("#checkbox")
        await checkbox.click()

        # Switch back to main frame
        await tab.switch_to_main_frame()

    await browser.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Proxy Support

Truedriver supports proxies in multiple formats, including authenticated proxies. Just pass the `proxy` argument to `td.start()`:

**Supported formats:**

- Simple: `"ip:port"` or `"http://ip:port"`
- Authenticated (string): `"username:password@ip:port"` or `"http://username:password@ip:port"`
- Authenticated (dict): `{ "server": "ip:port", "username": "user", "password": "pass" }`

**Example:**
```python
import asyncio
import truedriver as td

async def main():
    # Simple proxy
    browser = await td.start(proxy="proxy.example.com:8080")


    # Authenticated proxy (string format)
    browser = await td.start(proxy="your-username:your-password@proxy.example.com:8080")

    # Authenticated proxy (dict format)
    proxy_config = {
        "server": "proxy.example.com:8080",
        "username": "your-username",
        "password": "your-password"
    }
    browser = await td.start(proxy=proxy_config)


    tab = await browser.get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
    print(await tab.get_content())
    await browser.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

> **Note:** Replace `your-username`, `your-password`, and `proxy.example.com:8080` with your actual proxy credentials. Truedriver automatically handles proxy authentication using the Chrome DevTools Protocol‚Äîno manual CDP handlers required.

### Advanced Configuration

Example with multiple features:

```python
import asyncio
import truedriver as td

async def main():
    # Start browser with proxy and custom user agent
    browser = await td.start(
        headless=False,
        proxy="user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080",
        user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36",
        browser_args=[
            "--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled",
            "--disable-web-security"
        ]
    )

    tab = await browser.get("https://example.com")

    # Work with iframes if needed
    frames = await tab.get_frames()
    print(f"Found {len(frames)} frames")

    # Find and interact with elements
    element = await tab.find("Click me")
    await element.click()

    await browser.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## What's New in Truedriver

Truedriver enhances the original zendriver with powerful new features for advanced web automation:

### üéØ **Full Iframe Support**

- **Switch between iframe contexts** with ease using `tab.switch_to_frame()`
- **Find frames by URL, name, or element** using `tab.find_frame_by_url()`, `tab.find_frame_by_name()`
- **Frame-aware operations** - all element finding and JavaScript execution works within the current frame
- **Perfect for hCaptcha, forms, and embedded widgets**

### üåê **Simple Proxy Support**

- **Multiple configuration formats**:
  - Simple: `"ip:port"`
  - Authenticated: `"user:pass@ip:port"`
  - Dict: `{"server": "ip:port", "username": "user", "password": "pass"}`
- **URL-based authentication** (like Playwright) - no complex CDP auth handlers
- **Works reliably** with Chrome, Brave, and Edge

### ü•∑ **Enhanced Stealth**

- **Advanced anti-detection techniques** for bypassing sophisticated bot detection
- **Improved fingerprint randomization** and user agent handling
- **Optimized browser arguments** for maximum undetectability
- **Better evasion** of modern anti-bot solutions

### üì¶ **Easy Migration from zendriver**

All zendriver code works with truedriver - just change your import:

```python
# Old
import zendriver as td

# New
import truedriver as td
```

### üöÄ **Real-World Examples**

- **Discord account creation** with proxy rotation and iframe handling
- **hCaptcha solving** using iframe switching
- **Complex form automation** across multiple frames
- **Stealth scraping** with enhanced undetection

## Rationale for the fork

Truedriver remains committed to `zendriver`'s goals of staying undetected for all modern anti-bot solutions and also keeps with the batteries-included approach of its predecessor. This project is a specialized fork of [`zendriver`](https://github.com/cdpdriver/zendriver/) which itself was forked from the original [`nodriver` repo](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/nodriver/).

Truedriver aims to provide enhanced stealth capabilities by:

1. Implementing advanced anti-detection techniques
2. Fine-tuning browser arguments for maximum stealth
3. Maintaining compatibility with zendriver's API while focusing on undetectability
4. Providing specialized builds for bypassing sophisticated bot detection systems
